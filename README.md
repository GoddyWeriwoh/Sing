The project is based on trying to do a competition whereby teams participate. These 
competitions are separated in yearly editions and each edition has trials which are used to 
screen players of a participating team, till the result, if at least one is left to win and in the 
contrary the team loses. 

There are 4 types of trials per edition, which can repeat. Paper publication, master 
studies, doctoral thesis, and budget request. 
 In the composer portion of the program, the user will oversee creating the trials and 
editions, specifying the various properties asked on the console, which vary depending on 
trials. 

In the conductor part, the players when going through these stages will be evolving 
from initially engineers, then to masters, and finally doctors, depending on if they reach a PI 
of 10 while at a certain level, always initially starting with 5 PI. And when a player is a 
master, they loose just half of PI when they are to lose points, and when doctors, they 
combine their previous master power to gaining double PI when about to gain points.

 For the trials, 
• Paper publication: Here, depending on quartile type, the player will receive or loose 
several points, when asked to play.
• Master studies: Has number of credits, that users must pass depending on some 
probability
• Doctoral thesis: Here, the player to pass there is an algorithm to pass a field of study 
of a certain difficulty
